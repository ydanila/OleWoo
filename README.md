OleWoo - Yet another TLB viewer. Original sources copied from http://www.benf.org/other/olewoo/

Oleview's a very handy tool, but it's got some really annoying niggles (only 1 typelibrary open at once, no search, slow on large TLBs, yadda yadda) - OleWoo is my attempt at building something which drags oleview kicking and screaming into at least the late 1990s!
